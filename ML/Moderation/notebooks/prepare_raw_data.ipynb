Rather, this is a word much more likely to be use by transgender people to describe those who aren\\'t, and a more logical comparison is with use of \"\"cracker\"\" by black people or \"\"breeder\"\" etc. by gay people. — 06:47, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)\"',\n",
       " '\" \\n\\n  \\n == Definition of redneck == \\n being a rednack has nothing to do with your social status at all. it does however describe where a person is from. it originated from farmers, why? because of their long days in the hot sun and being sunburned on the neck, hence the term \"\"redneck\"\". it has been misused and mis represented over the years to describe a certain class of people and thier life style, just like the word nigger. not picking straws ( well i guess i am) but the word nigger should be used in place of redneck. the webster says that nigger is that anyone who is a nasty unclean vulgar person is a nigger, it does not state a color. i guess like the words redneck and nigger both have been widely miss represented to the point of know return. i concider myself a redneck only because i am from the country, and because i was raised on a farm.  \\n \\n\\n The first paragraph should say what redneck is, but it doesn´t. It only states that the term is a pejorative stereotype and defines its geographical area of usage, which is fine. But I guess most of  us readers (specially those like me, who live neither in the U. S. nor in Canada) would like to know, since the first paragraph, that the term initially refered in a pejorative way to white poor people from the southern United States, and afterwards extended to white rural people from the whole nation and provinces of Canada. That piece of information should be, as a matter of fact, the first one of the whole article.   \\n *That\\'s a fair point... so why not be bold and make the edit? When you do, please cite a source. If you\\'re not sure how to do that, post the information about your source here and we can help.   \\n\\n Thank you. To tell you the truth, I´m not quite sure my posted definition of redneck is the right one. It is what I gathered from reading this article and some additional info outside the Wikipedia site. My point is to depict, from the beginning, the ethnic group the term refers to; and, since I\\'m not sure, I guess I\\'ll leave the being bold part to someone else. At least, for now. Thanks again, anyway.   \\n\\n :From what I\\'ve read and heard, the term \"\"redneck\"\" has a somewhat different connotation in England and South Africa than it does in America. This is briefly mention in the article, but perhaps it should be expanded upon?   \\n\\n :In response to earlier questions, now I\\'m not sure if the terms \"\"the American West\"\" and \"\"the American East\"\" would be defined in the same way in a modern context as they would be in the context of the 1800\\'s. The whole issue may be far more complex than I had previously thought.   \\n\\n We need to distinguish between the origins of the term \"\"redneck\"\" and its present day meaning. Today the term is used (in the US) to mean either (1)a manual worker of European ancestry who hails from a rural or southern place, or (2) any American of European ancestry who expresses (or is suspected of holding) the views and attitudes that are associated with a certain stereotype of rural and southern white workers. It is a put-down, like \"\"n-,\"\" except that it includes class snobbery as well as a racial element. It\\'s most popular among people who are insecure about their own social position.      \\n\\n :From my experience, #2 is the most commonly-used definition.  #1 sounds more like a \"\"hick\"\" or \"\"hillbilly.\"\"    \\n\\n ::The first definition is inaccurate, at least the part about being a manual worker.   \\n\\n == Family Guy Influence? == \\n\\n Family Guy had an episode recently poking fun at rednecks. mention it somewhere please. \\n \\n\\n Dude every show pokes fun at rednecks. Family Guy\\'s not exactly the first, although that show has an unusually negative view of the South...    \\n\\n == thanks to whoever cited me on \"\"... blunt definition\"\" (first paragraph part) but == \\n\\n I h',\n",

The point of not including the \\'pseudoscience\\' comment is that it is irrelevant in terms of the topic.

Students from A@E usually get remarks such as \"\"F*** you academies\"\" from Dwight Morrow Students. Many also believe the two schools should remain separate because they earned the right to attend the academies (by applying) and A@E shouldn\\'t be \"\"just another regular public school.\"\" \\n\\n I reverted it back to the old version.

       " \"::I see your concerns, and many people have expressed them before. It is, of course, important to note that Wikipedia is an Encyclopedia, meaning a compendium of general knowledge, whether it is objectionable or not. The content disclaimer explains it well. So having an article on these slurs (and believe me there's more article where that comes from) can be a legitimate topic if treated well. I don't think there is any violation of NPOV, since they are merely representing the (admittedly subjective) material in an objective way. I do have a little concern about those lists only in that lists of words tend to violate (in my view) the policy that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but it would take a major reversal of our ways to do anything about that. Wikipedia does not shy away from possibly objectionable material, instead it tries to treeat it in an NPOV way (for which I am proud). See, for example, some pretty good articles at fuck, nigger, and motherfucker. ·\",\n",

       " '3000 years ago the earth was just a few hundred years old. In the land of odoor there lived a mighty kingdom. They were the Angelo Visgoths! They werea mighty breed of warriors. They were ruled by a king along the name of Russell The Magnificent. King Russell had miles and miles of land under his nation. He had every army under his control. His nation was far stretched from one sea to another. His armies were the size of oceans. His royal gaurd was strong.  \\n\\n But far across the Ionian seas lived a man under no kings rule! his name was Gaius. He lived in a very rich and plentiful land, that was found to be eyed by many great leaders. These lands had no ruler. King Russell did not approve of this. He claimed that these people were barbariouse. So Russell sent tax men. Known as the IRS. The leader of this group was led by a not so smart nigger, (but, who knows a smart nigger.)  \\n\\n Gaius did not take this so kindly. Gaius and his followers who were just as well farmers themselves joined together and defeated the IRS and sent the Nigger obamas head back to Russell! SoRussell sent his army across the seas to defeat these farmers but again and again Gaius killed his men. Gaius had a son his Name was George Washington. \\n\\n George Washington Had won agaimst russell and made a new country today its known as America!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",

What was the number one source of death?  Disease and starvation caused by the war which America choose to wage.  Some of this disease and starvation was caused by concentration camps set up all over the Philippines, in which villagers were herded into camps and anything outside of the camps was shot on site.  similar to what happened in Vietnam.   The number two source was probably Americans killing villagers, which the historical record is clear happened.  I could expand this page by dozens, maybe even hundreds of pages of testimonies from the soldiers themselves, often boosting of killing \"\"niggers\"\" to their families back home.  Many head commanders  were put on trial for killing villagers.  I am sure Boot never mentioned this in his one-sided,biased, jingoist polemic.

(See below for more on Boot) \\n\\n ::Way at the bottom of \"\"main causes\"\" is alleged attrocities of the insurrgents.  I say alleged because they were not almost always not reported by the insurgents themselves, as all of the American attrocities were reported in letters and in trials on the American side, but they were reported by a third party: the high command of the American military.  Some of these attrocities were found to be fake or of dubious nature. Did the attrocities happen by insurgents: absolutly.  And you can include this in the article, but when you do, it will be buried by the attrocities of Americans. \\n\\n ::Your complain also ignores that America invaded the Philippines.  So you are sticking up for a military that invaded a country and demonizing the Filipinos attempted to stop this invasion.  Some of there tactics of the insurregents were cruel, to be sure, and can be mentioned in the article.  \\n\\n ::I have read portions of \"\"The Savage Wars of Peace\"\". Boot\\'s writings disgust me. He is a savage jingoist.  He glamorizes these wars as grand military adventures and portrays many American war criminals as mythical heroes. I remember how he trivalized the American written Haiti constitution, benefical to American business interests, and how Americans forced the puppet govenment to sign it.  Did Boot mention Jacob H. Smiths order to \"\"kill everyone over ten\"\"?  Did Boot mention the water torture?  Did Boot mention the killing of POWs by Americans (which the Filipinos also did)?  No.  \\n\\n ::Anon, this says a lot about your own character and ideology that you quote Boot as gospel, blindly ignoring this shameful part of Ameircan history. A history, if you are an average american that you probably know nothing about. The Filipinos did not kill 100,000-200,000 of their own countrymen. The Filipinos would never have killed anyone supporting the invading power America, if America would not have invaded in the first place.  \\n\\n ::God forgive America and Americans like Boot and you Anon. \"',\n",

The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I\\'ve interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn\\'t. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won\\'t help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you\\'ve been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!\\n\\nWhy do you delete the number of \"\"Carson\"\" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It\\'s a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It\\'s not a place to gain revenge on someone you don\\'t like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nI\\'ve copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)\\n\\n Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website\\'s message board he admitted he was falsefying William\\'s own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose\\'s appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, \"\"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.\"\" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman\\'s uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose\\'s irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion. \\n\\nGreetings\\n\\nGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s.

There are also socio-economic reasons behind this as southern Europeans but particularly eastern Europeans are stereotypically deemed more backwards and less well off than their northern European cousins.\\n\\nForms ultimately derived from Latin  have been borrowed into various non-Romance languages, and may be used to refer to people without negative connotation; The Hungarian  referred to black Africans without any negative connotations until the 1990s when its meaning changed under English influence. In Latvian, \"\"nēģeris\"\" is still referred to black Africans without any derogatory meaning. The word nigger, typically with the same spelling and more or less similar pronunciation, also appears as a loanword in languages other than English and has the same racist connotations as the English word. In Nazi propaganda, the German compound niggerjazz was used as a derogatory term for jazz music, which Nazi ideology held was a degenerate form of music. In Yiddish, \"\"shvartzer\"\", meaning \\'black\\' is considered offensive while \"\"neger\"\" is the standard word.\\n\\nNon-human uses\\nIn the past, nigger was sometimes used as a synonym for \"\"defect\"\", deriving from the phrase \"\"nigger in the woodpile\"\", which originally referred to escaping slaves hiding among woodpiles being transported on trains. It came to mean some unseen problem.Definition of nigger in the woodpile For example, the May 1886 issue of Scientific American, page 308 said, \"\"The consequence of neglect might be that what the workmen call ‘a nigger’ would get into the armature, and burn it so as to destroy its service.\"\"\\n\\nThe term nigger was used in lumber mills until the mid-point of the 20th century. It refers to a device that turns a log while it is being stripped of its bark. This may be an off-hand reference to the prejudicial use of the word, as until the machine was invented, this was considered a job too dangerous for anyone other than a black man.\\n\\nLiterary uses\\nNigger has a long history of controversy in literature. Carl Van Vechten, a white photographer and writer famous as a supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, provoked debate and some protest from the African American community by titling his 1926 novel Nigger Heaven. The controversy centered on the use of the word in the title and fueled the sales of the hit novel. Of the controversy, Langston Hughes wrote:\\n\\nThe poem Little Topsy\\'s SongLittle Topsy\\'s Song: Sung by the Hutchinson family A modern recording. Music by Asa B. Hutchinson(1823–1884), Boston: Oliver Ditson, 1853Little Topsy\\'s Song: Text and Sources Music by Asa Hutchinson and also by Henry Russell (1801–1900) written in about 1845 by Eliza Cook has the first stanza\\n\\'Topsy neber was born, / Neber had a moder; / Specks I growed a nigger brat, / Just like any oder.\\n\\nThe famous controversy over Mark Twain\\'s novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), a classic frequently taught in American schools, revolves largely around the novel\\'s 215 uses of the word, often referring to Jim, Huck\\'s raft mate.{{cite web\\n| title= Adventures',\n",

       " '\"\\nComment clarified as requested. I neither regard the citations in question as particularly respectable on the one hand, nor care on the other hand whether they were brought down from the mountain on stone tablets with Supreme Court certification and approval; the operative point is that they are irrelevant. Read what I said: \"\"Since neither of the two \"\"inventions\"\" is of any significance, reference to them should be ... removed from Wikipedia ... if it is felt that some justification for calling him an inventor is necessary, possibly one of his condoms could replace the tower doodle.\"\" Consider: suppose some reputable news source were to assert that in primary school one of his school friends noticed him wetting his pants on one occasion; we would object to such an item as being too non-encyclopaedic and non-notable for inclusion in WP, irrespective of whether the citation were from an unknown local rag or from the Times supported by affidavits. To justify inclusion presumed accuracy and verifiability are necessary, but not sufficient. The condom thing is a pretty ignominious basis for calling him an inventor, groupie stuff in short, but since it is marketed and patented, and possibly effective for all I know, go ahead; some readers might enjoy a snigger. The other two items never got beyond childish nonsense even if mommy thinks they are ever so cute; more or less on a par with the pants wetting.   \"',\n",

Here is the joke: Mark Fuhrman, with his LAPD police badge and his gun, with all of those yummmy bullets in it, would do traffic stops on black people.  If you think that was a DWB kind of thing, well, other might feel that way too... Anyway the joke is this:  He did not love those niggers that stopped, he loved the effect that using, under color of authority (pun intended), the WORD nigger has on them emotionally.  See, if he could just get an emotional repsonse from those niggers, he might be able to create an excuse in order to insert some of those yummy bullets into them.  Mostly, those niggers just sat and and took it.  Some non-admin Wikipedians find themselves in the same situation as those guys. Ironically, Mark probably makes a lot more money with his books now than he ever did as a policeman.  Provided that people merely purchase and read his books, but do not actually take them seriously, maybe we are all better off that way. He's got more money.  He does not use the n-word anymore.  He does not carry a gun and use the n-word under color of authority.  Surely, that is best of all possible worlds, is it not?\"]"
